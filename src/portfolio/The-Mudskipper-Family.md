I've been a Sound Engineer and Foley Sound Artist for the game The Mudskipper Family.

The Mudskipper Family is a game about the life on Curacao. All sounds you hear in this game are made by hand, divided in music and foley sound effects. I was one of the people responsible for the foley sound effects in this game. I also helped with the recordings of the voice-overs.
