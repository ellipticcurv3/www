# The Mudskipper Family: Sound Engineer

<style>.big-hero.hasimage { background-position: left top, top center !important; }</style>

I've been a Sound Engineer and Foley Sound Artist for The Mudskipper Family, a game about a family of fishes living on the island of Curaçao.

A family of Mudskipper fishes lives on Curaçao. One day, the smallest member of the family, Eva, is suddenly abducted by a notorious bird living on the island: the Wara-Wara bird! The whole family got shocked by this event and want to bring back Eva. The Mudskippers are challenged to look for her and make the family complete again.

## Foley Sounds

Sound has always been very underrated in both the film and game industries. Yet they enhance the overall experience if the sounds used fit well. The opposite is also possible &ndash; a wrong sound can become distracting and affect the quality of the movie or game in bad sense.

Each character in The Mudskipper Family has unique properties, so it is up to the player to determine which character is best suited in certain situations. Because the uniqueness of the characters, each character has their own characteristic sounds. These sounds are called 'Foley Sounds', named after Jack Foley. Foley sounds are environmental and effect sounds that supports a movie or game. Some examples of foley sounds you can think of are: a "splash" as soon as one of the characters jump into the water and various ambient sounds such as wind and the rustle of leaves.

We used field recording to record our foley sounds. This means that all sounds from our game were recorded in the Arnhem – Nijmegen area with a field recorder.

It is important to have a good plan in order to create succesful foley sounds. You can't just go out on the street and record the sound of random things, and then figure out where it might fit within your project. That is why we have built a profile of our game characters, the map and items of the game. From this we have derived a list of (possible) foley sounds. This gave us the input we needed to create a plan and be more concrete of which sounds would be recorded.

To guarantee higher quality, we have divided the Foley Sound artists from our own team into duos. With the list by our sides, both parties made the same recordings, but in different places, using different techniques. After all of our foley sounds were recorded, we had a team meeting and assessed each other's sounds. The chosen sounds had to be 'tailored'. This meant that we would cut all sounds to the right size, made the volume consistent and made agreements about the technical requirements.

Eventually, we added the sounds to our game together with the programming and level teams, so that we could experience the sounds for real. The end result was great.

## Extra things

Besides creating Foley Sounds I was responsible for recording the voice-over of the intro video. I also helped editing the game music and controlliing the sound during the game presentation.
