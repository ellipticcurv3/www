# Vormkracht10: UX Research & Design

<!-- Situation -->

To obtain my college degree, I did an internship at Vormkracht10, a web design and development agency from Nijmegen. Vormkracht10 builds websites and web applications for the corporate market.

The business relations who let Vormkracht10 build their websites like to manage and maintain their own website. To make this possible, Vormkracht10 has built their own Content Management System, called '<Tooltip text="Trivia: Slim means 'clever' in Dutch">Slim</Tooltip>'. This smart piece of software ensures that customers can manage their business website. Not each customer is the same, so Vormkracht10 has built Slim in such a way that it can be extended with additional functionalities, in order to fit it to the needs of each customer.

Over the years, various functionalities have been developed and added to Slim. Testing the user experience was a secondary priority. <!-- Task --> To investigate the impact of this, Vormkracht10 asked me to conduct research into the user experience of the system and then write a design document containing proposals for possible improvements.

<!-- Actions -->

During the internship I worked according to the Design Thinking methodology. Design Thinking uses an iterative-incremental approach, which means that each piece is individually investigated, (re)designed, tested, improved and implemented.

To have an overview of the functionalities within the existing CMS and the possible user groups, I first drew some Use Case Diagrams. These UCDs indicate which functionalities certain groups of people use within the system. For example &mdash; when running a webshop &mdash; the copywriter would use different functionalities of the CMS than the catalog manager would use.

In addition to the different groups of users, it also became clear which functionalities are important for almost all users. Based on that, I have sent a survey to a large group of customers. This gave me a general view of ​​the user experience. When the survey results came in, I contacted the customers and conducted in-depth interviews, so that in addition to the measurable results from the survey, I also got a more personal view of the users, their background and what matters to them.

A lot of qualitative information has been obtained from the interviews. This qualitative information is very important when researching the user experience of a system. By combining the Use Case diagrams, the results of the survey and the information obtained from the interviews, I made usability test plans. When writing a usability test, it is important to include pre-test and post-test questions and to describe the task, steps within that task and the fail/pass conditions. In addition to that, it is also very important to keep a close eye on the user when performing a task, especially regarding the user's non-verbal communication. While taking a test, it is okay to ask questions for clarification, but prevent that you unintentionally encourage the user to take a certain action. I.e. don't guide the user (during the tasks), let them make mistakes when performing them, those mistakes are important for your research, as they will tell you which things need to be improved.

<!-- Result -->

Based on the test results from the usability test, I designed prototypes that could serve as an improvement for the CMS. I tested these prototypes and improved them according to the iterative-incremental Design Thinking methodology. I then prepared a report containing recommendations based on my studies, so that Vormkracht10 could improve their CMS.

<!-- Reflection -->

The internship at Vormkracht10 was very interesting and valuable to me. I certainly enjoyed working at Vormkracht10 because I was able to work in an investigative and analytical way, I was able to express my creativity and had an advisory role in improving the user experience of the CMS. I am glad that I could help Vormkracht10 in improving the User Experience of Slim and let the users reach their goals in a better, more intuitive way.
