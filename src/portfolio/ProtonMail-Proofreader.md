I'm one of the proofreaders of the Dutch translations for ProtonMail, an end-to-end encrypted email service based in Switzerland.

# Responsibilities

- Making ProtonMail available in Dutch (the main goal)
- Making agreements upon usage of language and grammar choices
- Solving language issues and challenges (e.g. some words don't have a one-on-one translation from English to Dutch, so it requires some creativity)
- Maintaining a Glossary and helping resolve common errors (e.g. some technical stuff that goes wrong)
