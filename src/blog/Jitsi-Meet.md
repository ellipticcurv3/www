# Jitsi Meet

Since there has been an increasing demand for online video conference solutions, I rented an additional server and installed Jitsi Meet, a free and open-source video conference solution. The address is [https://meet.ricardo.nu/](https://meet.ricardo.nu/).

## Important to know

- Anyone can use this server free of charge.
- This server is fully dedicated to Jitsi Meet, no other software is running on it.
- Conference rooms can be easily created by putting something behind [https://meet.ricardo.nu/](https://meet.ricardo.nu/), for example [https://meet.ricardo.nu/nightcap](https://meet.ricardo.nu/nightcap).
- It is recommended to set a password to protect conference rooms.

## More information

Soon, I will publish a guide to let you know how you can set up your own Jitsi Meet instance. It will require some knowledge of Linux system administration, but if you already worked with Linux or the macOS terminal, you will be able to set up your own instance within 5 to 10 minutes.

I am also willing to help set up an instance for your company or association, so you can use Jitsi Meet on your own domain. [Give me a call][2] or [send me an email][3] to discuss the possibilities.
