# Photography on Unsplash

I now share my personal (non-paid) photographs on Unsplash, to do something in return for this awesome community.

## What is Unsplash?

Unsplash is a website to share and download free photographs. It's a bit like open source software &ndash; but for photographs instead of software. I often use it when I create a visual design for a new website. It adds a nice photographic touch to the designs which I show to my clients.

Photography is also my semi-professional hobby and I occasionally take my Canon 5D Mark III with me and go somewhere to take photos. Because I love the community of Unsplash and it saved me so much time, I wanted to do something in return. So I decided to make some of my (non-paid) photography available on Unsplash as well.

## What to do next?

Go [follow me on Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/ricardobalk). Download the photographs you like. Use them, mix them, do whatever you want with them. I would definitely appreciate it if you give me some credits, but it is not required at all.
