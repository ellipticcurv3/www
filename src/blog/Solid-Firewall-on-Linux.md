# Solid Firewall Configuration with iptables

By default, Linux uses an empty firewall which means that all traffic will pass (with some exceptions). As long as you don't have server applications running and are using a router with a firewall, that would not be an issue.

But most developers use Linux mainly to install server applications and work with them. Wouldn't it be great to have a rock solid firewall setup to prevent leaking data to the local network or, in case of a public server, the outside world?

This article gives a few examples of solid firewall setups which could help devops to secure networking setup.

## Client-side examples

#### Basic Solid Client Firewall

The following example shows a basic client side setup which...

* Allows incoming local loop-back (`lo`) traffic (e.g. connections to `localhost`)
* Allows outgoing traffic.
* Allows incoming traffic of which is a response to outgoing traffic.
* Drops all other, unspecified traffic.

> **WARNING: Do not use the following set-up on a server.**
>
> It drops incoming connections by default (`iptables -P INPUT DROP`), so after closing a connection, you won't be able to connect again!

```sh
## Reset standard policies and clear the firewall rules
iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT
iptables -F

## Accept local loopback connections and incoming connections from established and related connection (e.g. to receive things back from outgoing traffic)
iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT

## Set standard policies (Drop all other, unspecified connections)
iptables -P INPUT DROP
iptables -P FORWARD DROP
iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT

## Save this setup
iptables-save > /etc/iptables/basic.v4
```

> **NOTE: iptables commands should be used as superuser.**
>
> So when you're a non-root user, you need to write `sudo iptables ` instead of `iptables`.

To restore the configuration, use `iptables-restore < /etc/iptables/basic.v4`.

## Server-side examples

### Basic HTTP(S) Server

You might want to run an HTTP/HTTP(S) server, visible to the outside world.

The following example shows a basic server side setup which...

* Allows incoming local loop-back (`lo`) traffic (e.g. connections to `localhost`)
* Allows outgoing traffic.
* Allows incoming traffic of which is a response to outgoing traffic.
* **Allows incoming traffic to ports `80` and `443`.**
* Drops all other, unspecified traffic.

```sh
## Reset standard policies and clear the firewall rules
iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT
iptables -F

## Accept local loopback connections and incoming connections from established and related connection (e.g. to receive things back from outgoing traffic)
iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT

## Accept those connections to ports 80 and 443 that haven't been rejected
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT

## Set standard policies (Drop all other, unspecified connections)
iptables -P INPUT DROP
iptables -P FORWARD DROP
iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT

## Save this setup
iptables-save > /etc/iptables/basic-server.v4
```

### Advanced HTTP(S) Server

You might want to make things a little more advanced.

The following example shows a bit more advanced server side setup which...

- Allows incoming local loop-back (`lo`) traffic (e.g. connections to `localhost`)
- Allows outgoing traffic.
- Allows incoming traffic of which is a response to outgoing traffic.
- Allows incoming traffic to ports `80` and `443`.
- **Limits the number of concurrent connections to ports `80` and `443` to a maximum of `20` connections per client.**
- **Rejects connections when that limit is reached.**
- Drops all other, unspecified traffic.

```sh
## Reset standard policies and clear the firewall rules
iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT
iptables -F

## Accept local loopback connections and incoming connections from established and related connection (e.g. to receive things back from outgoing traffic)
iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT

## Set a maximum number of connections to ports 80 and 443, reject connections when they exceed the maximum number of connections
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --syn --dport 80 -m connlimit --connlimit-above 20 -j REJECT --reject-with tcp-reset
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --syn --dport 443 -m connlimit --connlimit-above 20 -j REJECT --reject-with tcp-reset

## Accept those connections to ports 80 and 443 that haven't been rejected
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT

## Set standard policies (Drop all other, unspecified connections)
iptables -P INPUT DROP
iptables -P FORWARD DROP
iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT

## Save this setup
iptables-save > /etc/iptables/advanced-server.v4
```

### Advanced HTTP(S) Server with (restricted) SSH access

The following example shows an even more advanced server side setup which...

- Allows incoming local loop-back (`lo`) traffic (e.g. connections to `localhost`)
- Allows outgoing traffic.
- Allows incoming traffic of which is a response to outgoing traffic.
- Allows incoming traffic to ports `80` and `443`.
- Limits the number of concurrent connections to ports `80` and `443` to a maximum of `20` connections per client.
- Rejects connections when that limit is reached.
- **Allows SSH connections from `123.456.789.123`.**
- Drops all other, unspecified traffic.

```sh
## Reset standard policies and clear the firewall rules
iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT
iptables -F

## Accept local loopback connections and incoming connections from established and related connection (e.g. to receive things back from outgoing traffic)
iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT

## Set a maximum number of connections to ports 80 and 443, reject connections when they exceed the maximum number of connections
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --syn --dport 80 -m connlimit --connlimit-above 20 -j REJECT --reject-with tcp-reset
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --syn --dport 443 -m connlimit --connlimit-above 20 -j REJECT --reject-with tcp-reset

## Accept those connections to ports 80 and 443 that haven't been rejected
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT

## Accept connections to SSH from a specific IP subnet
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -s 123.456.789.123 --dport 22 -j ACCEPT

## Set standard policies (Drop all other, unspecified connections)
iptables -P INPUT DROP
iptables -P FORWARD DROP
iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT

## Save this setup
iptables-save > /etc/iptables/advanced-server-ssh.v4
```
