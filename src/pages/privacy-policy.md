# Privacy Statement

> TL;DR version &mdash; Your personal information is safe, because I don't have any of it :wink:

- **I don't save cookies.** This website does not need them in order to function properly. :smiling_face_with_three_hearts:
- **I don't use analytics software**. No Google Analytics nor any self-acclaimed 'privacy-friendly' analytics. :no_good:
- **The server is located in ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland.** Switzerland is not under EU / US jurisdiction and is known for its very strict privacy laws. :switzerland:
- **I don't save website access logs.** I only save error logs, keep them in memory instead of disk, and purge them after 14 days. You could always [access my website over Tor](http://3rfoq3ia75hnxgpmtwyeyvbjbhym354tcy4ox2jaqjqhtcmd4i2mt2id.onion/), if you don't trust it. :nerd_face:
- **I only use strong security standards.** No time for weaknesses. I've got an **<span style="color: #00cc00;">A+</span>** on [SSLLabs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=ricardobalk.nl) and on [SecurityHeaders.io](https://securityheaders.com/?q=ricardobalk.nl&followRedirects=on). :muscle:
- **Everything is open source.** By publishing the source code of my website, I allow anyone to inspect the code, play with it and helping me in improving my website. :rainbow:
