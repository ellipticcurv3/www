# Components

This directory contains the components that are used in the VuePress theme.

Please keep in mind that the directory `global/` is a special one, i.e. components added here will be available globally. An example for this is [the Tooltip component](./global/Tooltip.vue), which could be used within pages and blog posts as well, simply by writing `<Tooltip text="Some explanation">Your original sentence</Tooltip>`
