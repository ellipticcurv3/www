<template><h1>About me&hellip;</h1>
<p>I'm a digital designer, front-end developer and blogger. I've studied Communcation &amp; Multimedia Design at HAN University of Applied Sciences and obtained my Bachelor of Science in February, 2019.</p>
<p>I have an intense love for UX/UI design, front-end web development and photography. Knowing that I both love graphic design and technology, I chose to combine those passions.</p>
<p>On my blog, you could learn more about the things I'm doing. There's also a portfolio available showing an overview of projects I worked on in the past.</p>
