<p>I now share my personal (non-paid) photographs on Unsplash, to do something in return for this awesome community.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-unsplash"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-unsplash">#</a> What is Unsplash?</h2>
<p>Unsplash is a website to share and download free photographs. It's a bit like open source software â€“ but for photographs instead of software. I often use it when I create a visual design for a new website. It adds a nice photographic touch to the designs which I show to my clients.</p>
<p>Photography is also my semi-professional hobby and I occasionally take my Canon 5D Mark III with me and go somewhere to take photos. Because I love the community of Unsplash and it saved me so much time, I wanted to do something in return. So I decided to make some of my (non-paid) photography available on Unsplash as well.</p>

<p>Go <a href="https://unsplash.com/ricardobalk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">follow me on Unsplash<OutboundLink/></a>. Download the photographs you like. Use them, mix them, do whatever you want with them. I would definitely appreciate it if you give me some credits, but it is not required at all.</p>
